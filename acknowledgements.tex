To be honest, I thought that would not finish this. I was already seeing myself giving up this masters due to a lot of
things: new country, new city, new job, huge load of work in my new job, baby coming... etc.. It was not easy to work on
double journey for lots of months, sleeping only 3 to 4 hours a day. But yes! It is over! Some people helped me to no
give up and keep up with that "stressful journey" and here they deserve my "Thank you!".

I would like to thank my advisor Stênio, by having me as his student, for the second time, and lending me some time of
his busy agenda, helping me out to finish this work.

Many thanks to my beloved wife Thaís, who was always supporting me during the years of this masters, telling me to never
give up and giving up time with me in favor of me working on this dissertation. Also, thanks to my baby boy Daniel, who
isn't even born yet, but helped me to finish this dissertation as fast as possible so I can enjoy some free time before
I lose them all after he is born :). Thanks to my mother Catari and my father Cândido for their support during this time
too.

Thanks to Andre, who was always telling me that we were going to end this and was also always warning me about the
important deadline dates of the University. I also would like to thank my friends here in Seattle: PP and Fabio, for
lending me some VMs on their Azure accounts, so I could run my benchmarks; Fernando, for good academic advices and
motivational speechs :).
