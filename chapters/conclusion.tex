\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conclusion}
In this paper we propose a new efficient and elegant algorithm to find flock patterns, being able to work in on-line
environments.  Our results show that we outperformed state-of-the-art solutions by 99\% without compromising accuracy.
We prove our efficiency by performing experiments in 4 different datasets, bot real and synthetic.

This work opens some avenues for future advanced research studies, as follows: (1) apply BitDF to try to solve indoor
flock pattern detection; (2) focus on particularities in Smart Cities scenarios, such as traffic jam detection; (3)
conceptual design of a parallelizable model of BitDF in order to take full advantage of modern multicore architectures.
