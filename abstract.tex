Pattern mining in spatio-temporal datasets is a really relevant subject in the academy and the industry nowadays, due to
its wide applicability in helping to solve real world problems. Many of them can be found in the context of Smart
Cities, like Traffic Management, Surveillance and Security and City Planning, to name a few. Among the various
spatio-temporal patterns that one can extract from a spatio-temporal dataset, the Flock pattern is one that has gained a
lot of attention, because of its intrinsic relation with the aforementioned real world problems. A lot of work has been
done in the academy, in order to provide algorithms able to identify the Flock pattern. However, none of them could
perform that task efficiently nor be able to scale well when a large dataset was the analysis target. Additionally, we
found that there was no system architecture proposal that could be simple and extensible enough to be used in the
various spatio-temporal pattern detection problems present today. Given that context, this dissertation proposes a
Generic System Archicture that can be used to solve a great number of spatio-temporal pattern mining problems. We then
validate such architecture by implementing on top of it an efficient flock detection algorithm aiming at achieving
considerable gains in execution time, without compromising accuracy, thus targeting real-time deployment and online
processing in Smart Cities. Last, but not least, we remodel our algorithm in order to take advantage of multi-core
architectures present in modern computers. Our results indicate that our proposal outperforms the current
state-of-the-art techniques, by achieving 99\% CPU time improvement and with our Multi-threaded model, we were able to
reduce the processing time of our proposed algorithm by 96\% in some cases. We prove the efficiency of our solution by
performing evaluation with both real and synthetic large datasets.
